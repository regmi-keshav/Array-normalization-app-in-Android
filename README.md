# Array-normalization-app-in-Android
This app basically gets the array input from the user and calcualte the normalization factor and then outputs the normalized array to the user

Build an app that does the following:
Ask the user to enter two arrays of integers (between 0 and 255), and combine them into an output array of integers as follows: 
Average the two arrays position-wise.
Normalise the averaged array by multiplying all elements with a scale factor such that the highest element is 255.
The scale factor is the same for all elements of the array.
Display the normalised array to the user.


For example, if the input arrays are [2, 200, 100] and [50, 4, 100], the averaged array is [26, 102, 100], and the final output from the program is [65, 255, 250].

The averaged array is only an intermediate value and not shown to the user.
